This is the YouTube extension used to pause the video whenever you will change your tabs or you will change your program. This usually helps a lot when we are watching any tutorial and at the same time we are coding or taking notes then we donâ€™t need to pause again and again just change the tab the video will automatically pause and you can do your task easily.
Thank You !!!
